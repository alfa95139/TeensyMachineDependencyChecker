# TeensyMachineDependencyChecker

This is a Machine Dependency Checker ported to TeensyDuino, and it is used in conjunction with usim, the 6809 Emulator by R.P. Bellis.
This is derived from usim/machdep.c.
This dependency checker may be useful for determining the endianness of other emulators for the Teensyduino or Arduino platforms.
